# Contributing to Estonian Runosong Morphological Corpus

Thank you for your interest in this experimental corpus project!

## About This Corpus

This is an **experimental baseline corpus** using non-LLM methods (EstNLTK + dictionaries + rule-based corrections) for morphological annotation of archaic dialectal Estonian texts.

**Estimated accuracy: 60-70%**

This corpus is not presented as a gold standard. Rather, it serves as:
- A methodological baseline for comparing with other approaches
- A foundation for developing better annotation methods
- A transparent example of non-LLM annotation challenges
- A resource for understanding archaic Estonian dialectal variation

## How to Contribute

### 1. Methodology Improvements

We welcome contributions that improve the annotation methodology:

**Algorithm enhancements:**
- Better hybrid scoring approaches for lemma selection
- Improved dialectal variant detection
- Enhanced morphological disambiguation strategies
- More effective dictionary lookup methods

**New processing methods:**
- Alternative approaches to suffix stripping
- Better handling of compound words
- Improved h-variation detection patterns
- Context-aware lemma selection

### 2. Comparative Analysis

Help compare different annotation approaches:

**LLM-based methods:**
- Test and document LLM annotation accuracy
- Compare LLM vs. rule-based approaches
- Analyze where each method excels or fails
- Propose hybrid LLM + rule-based systems

**Alternative tools:**
- Try other morphological analyzers
- Compare with different dictionary resources
- Test cross-lingual approaches (using Finnish/related languages)
- Evaluate ensemble methods

### 3. Evaluation and Analysis

Contribute analysis of the existing corpus:

**Accuracy assessment:**
- Evaluate annotation quality on sample sets
- Identify systematic error patterns
- Analyze method performance by dialect/poem type
- Compare automated vs. manual annotation

**Linguistic insights:**
- Document dialectal variation patterns
- Analyze archaic morphological forms
- Study annotation challenges in runosong texts
- Identify ambiguous cases needing expert input

### 4. Documentation Improvements

Help make this resource more useful:

**Technical documentation:**
- Clarify processing methods
- Document edge cases and limitations
- Add usage examples for specific research tasks
- Improve code comments and examples

**Methodological documentation:**
- Explain design decisions
- Document known limitations
- Add references to relevant literature
- Describe evaluation procedures

## Submitting Contributions

### For Code/Methodology Changes

1. **Open an issue** describing the proposed improvement
2. **Explain the rationale**: Why is this approach better?
3. **Provide evidence**: Test results, accuracy improvements, etc.
4. **Include code**: Share scripts or modifications
5. **Document limitations**: What doesn't this approach handle well?

### For Analysis/Evaluation

1. **Share methodology**: How did you evaluate the corpus?
2. **Provide data**: Sample sets, test results, statistics
3. **Compare approaches**: What alternatives did you try?
4. **Document findings**: What patterns did you discover?

### For Documentation

1. **Propose changes** via issues or pull requests
2. **Maintain tone**: Transparent about limitations, not authoritative
3. **Include examples**: Concrete illustrations help readers
4. **Cite sources**: Reference relevant literature and resources

## Annotation Philosophy

This corpus follows these principles:

### Transparency Over Perfection

- Openly acknowledge ~60-70% estimated accuracy
- Document confidence scores as method reliability, not accuracy
- Mark ambiguous cases explicitly
- Provide method provenance for every annotation

### Methodological Foundation

- Serve as baseline for comparing better approaches
- Enable research on annotation methodology
- Support development of improved tools
- Facilitate comparative analysis

### Community Collaboration

- Welcome alternative approaches and criticism
- Share knowledge about dialectal annotation challenges
- Build on each other's improvements
- Foster open discussion of limitations

## What We Don't Need

- **"Error corrections"** as if this were a gold standard corpus
- **Claims of definitive correct annotations** for archaic dialectal material
- **Additions without methodology documentation**
- **Contributions that aren't reproducible**

**Remember**: This is experimental work on challenging archaic dialectal texts. Transparency about limitations and methodological rigor are more valuable than claims of high accuracy.
